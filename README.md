#Welcome to this silly repository
Hi, I'm **LaEntropia**, i'm learning data analysis bacause i hate myself, to do that i'm using python so my little brain can absorb the enormous amount of information, right now i'm following a tutorial made by **Datadaft** in youtube (I'll leave the link at the end) so you can check the proyects i've made for practicing data science (sorry if the code is too messy)
