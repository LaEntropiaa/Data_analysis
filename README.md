Hi, i'm no longer watching that last tutorial, i'm just discovering and learning DSA and learning linear algebra with the book "Linear algebra done right" (its available for free in the webpage of the book, look it up like that), i'm now preparing to enter and understanding stadistics and the elementals of this branch of programming.
